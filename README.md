# Land_of_Lisp
This repository will store the example in land of lisp.
I will upload example in the book for practice, you can take it without noticing me.

Because of the order in my system, Ch6.5 is in front of Ch6. I think it is bad. So I decide to use the notation in music, changing Ch6.5 to Chflat7. Because flat means down a note half step, but Chflat7 may become the lastest file when I finish all notes. En..., well, I think this way is better than the first.

# Update 4/1/2018
I decide to rename this repo to "CL", and it'll be used to store something about CL.
